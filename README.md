Windbag direct numerical simulation code
========================================

A computational fluid dynamics code for the direct numerical simulation of
transitional and turbulent fluid flows.

NOTE: This project is a work in progress and does not work yet.  I have
implemented much of the backend that supports various operations, but I have
yet to implement any of the numerical methods or post-processing operations.
Basic grid generation in parallel does work, though.


Usage
-----

    $ mpirun -n 2 ./windbag [INPUT_FILE]
